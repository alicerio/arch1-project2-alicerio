# Project 2 - Blinky Buzzy Toy
### In order to load the program into the MSP430, type:
make load
## Description
The objective of the lab was to make a Blinky Buzzy Toy with a MSP430 that was
given to us. I used the four switches of the device to play a song or to make
sounds, while at the same time, the led changes from green to red and
vicecversa when pressing the switches.
